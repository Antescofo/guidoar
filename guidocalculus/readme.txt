This application is based on Qt.
In addition to the guidoar library, it makes use of the following guido components:
	- GUIDOEngine library
	- GuidoQt library
	- GraphicsSceneMainWindow library
The project (.pro) is setup to refer to the guido library at ../../../guidolib
i.e. the guido library repository should be at the same level than the guidoar library.
